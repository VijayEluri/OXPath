RELEASE NOTES
-----
Thank you for using OXPath!  We hope that you enjoy it.  OXPath is released under a BSD-style license (license.txt)

The release notes are contained in release-document.pdf.  It contains specifics of the API.  We also include oxpath-overview.pdf, which contains an overview of the language.

This is a prototype of academic software described in the publications at 
diadem-project.info/oxpath.  The tool itself is located in /bin, where the subfolders indicate the currently supported platforms, win32 and linux 64.  Inside these folders are the main (executable) oxpath jars for each platform, as well as a folder of dependencies.

The /apidocs folder contains the javadoc output of the source.  The main class 
is uk.ac.ox.comlab.oxpath.core.OXPathNavigator, and it contains the 
principal parts of the API.  Information on its use is contained in release-document.pdf.

The browser API is provided by diadem.commons, another open source project within DIADEM that we are preparing for release soon.

If you have any feedback (e.g. comments, bugs), please send to 
oxpath@diadem-project.info.
